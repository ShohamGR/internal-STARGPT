Lennart:
This dataset comes from a consumer-to-consumer marketplace and includes listings with structured fields (e.g., item
condition, shipping) and high-cardinality textual inputs like product names, brand names, and descriptions. The goal is
to predict the item price. Hierarchical category fields (e.g., Women/Jewelry/Necklaces) are retained as textual inputs.
The dataset is ideal for evaluating semantic reasoning in text-rich, user-generated data.

Description: Predict the price of items sold in the online marketplace of Mercari based on
    information from the product page like name, description, free shipping availability, etc.
    This data originates from a 2017 Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/
    mercari-price-suggestion-challenge/), in which 1st place and 3rd place engineered
    dataset-specific text features such as customized bag-of-words and character N-grams, carefully
    tuned learning-rate/batch-size schedules, and specially ensembled models in a dataset-specific manner.

 Dataset found from the paper: Benchmarking multimodal automl for tabular data with text fields. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.02705.
