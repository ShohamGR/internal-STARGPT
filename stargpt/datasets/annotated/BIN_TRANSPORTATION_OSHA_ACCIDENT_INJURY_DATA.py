Description: 
Context
Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) is a dicspline centered on implementing practices for environmental protection and safety in a workplace. Energy companies place a strong emphasis on HSE when conducting day to day operations, whether it is on the field or in an office. A major challenge with HSE, however, is monitoring and managing HSE incidents across an enterprise. The common practice for incident management is analyzing detailed incident reports. This can be cumbersome and time-consuming, because in most cases, these reports contain unstructured text. To increase efficiency, companies are seeking technologies that allow them to derive valuable insights from unstructured HSE data efficiently.

Content
This dataset contains abstracts of the accidents and injuries of construction workers from 2015-2017. There is some structured data around the unstructured text abstracts, such as Degree of Injury, Body Part(s) Affected, and Construction End Use.

Acknowledgements
This is OSHA data which is publicly available.

Inspiration
What are the most buildings/structures to build? What trends do we see in injuries in terms of time of day, time of year, etc.? What is the reason injuries are occurring? Where do we need more training and safety measures in place?

Abstract Text (object, 4829 distinct): ['At 1:45 p.m. on January 9, 2017, an employee of a poultry processor was working in an engine room.  The employee observed a leak of anhydrous ammonia and took action.  No one was injured in this incident, which garnered considerable publicity. ', 'At approximately 2:45 p.m. on January 5, 2017, an employee was retrieving serial and model numbers from AC units on the roof. The employee fell through a fiberglass panel on the roof and hit the ground below inside the warehouse of the facility. The employee suffered from head trauma and was killed.\t ', 'At approximately 4:00 p.m. on March 23, 2017, Employee #1, a carpenter, was drilling 0.25-inch holes in a precast concrete ceiling panel working from a 10 foot high step ladder.  He was found on the floor with the ladder on top of him, dead. ', 'At approximately 1:00 a.m. on March 14, 2017, Employee #1 was pulling two pieces of metal rectangular tubes measuring approximately 3-inch by 6-inch by 9.67 foot long and weighing approximately 175 pounds.  The metal tubes were stored leaning against a wall with other materials unrestrained. He was trying to transfer the tubes from a small wheeled storage trailer to a larger one to transport them.  Employee #1 was struck in the head causing a blunt force trauma.  Employee #1 died of either the blunt force trauma to his head or from a possible heart attack. ', 'At approximately 5:34 p.m. on February 10, 2017, Employee #1 was on top of a conveyor and cleaning it. While he cleaned the conveyor, it energized and began moving. Employee #1 was thrown from the conveyor and struck a floor, sustaining unspecified hip and neck injuries. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center, where he received treatment and was then hospitalized. ', 'At 10:30 a.m. on July 16, 2015, an employee was installing siding, flashing, and gutters on a residential house.  The employee fell approximately 10 feet to the ground and is killed from blunt trauma injuries. ', 'At approximately 7:15 a.m. on March 14, 2017, Employee #1 was directing a derrick work crew on how to un-set packer within an oil well.  The top half of the derrick mast collapsed causing the traveling block to crash down striking and killing Employee #1. ', 'On March 22, 2017, an employee was making stucco mix. The employee got inside the lift basket on the forklift to carry stucco mix to the work area.  The basket was unattached and fell off the forks, carrying the employee with it. The employee was hospitalized and treated for fractured cheekbone. ', 'At approximately 11:00 p.m. on March 27, 2017, Employee #1 was cleaning a mixing tank.  The power was turned on and Employee #1 was struck by the agitator and killed. ', "At 5:00 p.m. on December 11, 2016, Employee #1 was standing on a temporary elevated working platform (scaffold) to inspect an air intake ductwork. He used a non-self-supporting ladder to gain access to a wooden plank, measuring 71 1/4 inches in length by 9 1/4 inches in width. The plank rested perpendicularly atop two parallel lengths of angle iron. The scaffold platform was measured to be 10 feet 8 inches above a concrete lower level.  Two coworkers working beneath did not observe Employee #1 immediately before he fell. Therefore, it is not known whether he fell from the scaffold platform, or fell while stepping down from the scaffold platform. The two coworkers below recall an 8-foot section of galvanized metal pipe hitting the floor, and bracing themselves in anticipation of other falling objects. The coworkers then looked to their right, where they found Employee #1's body. The employee was killed from craniocerebral injuries due to blunt force head trauma. "]
